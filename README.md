1- At the beginning of the game, one of the 4 keys lights up randomly producing simultaneously a sound associated to the key. 2- The player has to press the same key. 3- Next,, again one of the four keys lights up randomly. 4- The player has to click the previously lit up key and the key which lit up now in the same order using his memory. 5- And so on... In each round a new key is added to the series and the game becomes all the more difficult as the player's memory is put to the test. 6- If the player doesn't make any mistake, the game goes on, so it is an endless game!
